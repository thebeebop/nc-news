# The Daily Dose (Northcoders News) 
A social news aggregation, web content rating, 
and discussion website. Built in Javascript using React.

The API used for this application was created during my back-end project when studying with Northcoders:

## Instructions:
For ease of use (and showcase purposes) I have not built any functionality that utilizes user authorization. 
Therefore, upon opening the app you will have been assigned a default user with the name 'jessjelly'. This can be changed to another user by clicking on the user-icon located in the top right-hand corner, which will take you to another page that'll allow you to choose from a list of VALID users. 

As a user, you have the ability to filter articles by topic, upvote or downvote, and leave a comment on a specified article.

## IMPORTANT
To run this locally on your machine you must have node version 17.8.0 or above.
