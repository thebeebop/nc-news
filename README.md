# The Daily Dose (Northcoders News) 
A social news aggregation, web content rating, 
and discussion website. Built in Javascript using React.

## Instructions:
For ease of use I have not built any functionality that utilizes user authorization. 
Therefore, upon opening the app you will have been assigned a default user with the name 'jessjelly'. This can be changed to another VALID user by clicking on the user icon in the top right-hand corner.
