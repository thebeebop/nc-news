# The Daily Dose (Northcoders News) 
A social news aggregation, web content rating, 
and discussion website. Built in Javascript using React.

## Instructions:
For ease of use (and showcase purposes) I have not built any functionality that utilizes user authorization. 
Therefore, upon opening the app you will have been assigned a default user with the name 'jessjelly'. This can be changed to another user by clicking on the user-icon located in the top right-hand corner, which will take you to another page that'll allow you to choose from a list of VALID users. 

As a user, you have the ability to filter articles by topic, upvote or downvote a topic and leave a comment on a specified article.
